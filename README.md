### Project overview
* This projec explores different business metrics and how they can be displayed graphically to follow them
* I explore the relation between sales, budget, costumers and products
* We can obtain conclusions that will help us to make better marketing campaigns and improve profits
* The tools used are SQL server and Power BI 

### Objectives:

The goal is to build a sales report that shows summarized information about the businessÂ´s current situation to understand how to make more profits. 

The most important indicators are sales, budget, top customers, and top products:


### Part 1: Txtraction 
The data was taken from the Microsoft sample data and was extracted using SQL server into csv files to use them in the Power BI dashboard.

Date_table was used to retrieve dates about the performances of the sales through time

Sales_table, product_table and customer_table show information about sales, products and customers in that order

You can see all the SQL queries **[HERE](https://github.com/Roberto121c/Sales_Management/tree/main/Query)**:
